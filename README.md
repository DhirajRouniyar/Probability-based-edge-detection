My homework 0 submission for the course CMSC733 Computer Processing of Pictorial Information. In this repository, a simple of version of PB boundary detection algorithm has been implemented. The classical approaches like Canny and Sobel edge detectors measures discontinuities in the image intensities to detect edges. The PB algorithm considers texture and color information along with intensity, making it a better performing algorithm.
